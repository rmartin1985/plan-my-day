# Plan My Day

How often have you been sitting at home on a day off and wishing you had made some plans? You know you want to go out and do something, but you don't even know where to start looking? 

Or maybe you found yourself on a business trip or a to see family in a city you are not too familiar with. You have some extra time to explore but don't know which places or things to do that would interest you.

This is where Plan My Day can help! 

We have created an application that will help get you out of your normal routine and out to explore something new. 

All you need to do is enter the name of the city you wish to search in and our app will give suggestions for popular museums, monuments, and restaurants along with some upcoming sporting events or concerts in the area. 

Each link is clickable to direct you to Google for more information about the site or to Ticketmaster to be able to buy tickets to that event. 

## Concept

For our group project, we wanted to create an application that would encourage people to experience something different about the city they are in as opposed to just the normal things that everyone thinks of. Most people forget to look for the local museums and monuments specifically and you can really learn a lot about the local culture just by stopping by these places. It can also help give back to the local community by supporting these institutions. 

It also helps to be shown a snap shot of the live events in town as there are always great events going on and someone may have not known an event was happening right in their own backyard. 

## User Story

AS A user
I WANT to be given options for events and activities in a specific city
SO THAT I can plan my my day and potentially experience something new

GIVEN a landing page with a description of the app   

WHEN I first load the page   

THEN I am asked to input the city I am located in   

WHEN I input that city   

THEN I am presented with a series of categories for different activities and events possible in that city   

WHEN I go through the categories presented to me   

THEN I can select which categories are most intriguing to me   

WHEN I say yes to the activities   

THEN I am presented with recommendations that pertain to each category that I said yes to   

WHEN I see the choices   

THEN I am now given a fun schedule to plan my day around   

WHEN I donâ€™t like the recommendations given   

THEN I can choose to populate a new random recommendation

## Future deployments

With unlimited time and resources we would like to upgrade and add a few more features to this app to make it even more usable in the real world

* We would like to access the past searched cities and load them their responses again should someone be in the same city often and want to search the city again. 
* We would like a more comprehensive restaurant API database for more options. Would love to integrate a feature to make reservations and see reviews and menu options as well. 
* We would like to find an API to access trails, hikes, other nature areas, and other events that people don't tend to think to search in order to give more options to do things outside and experience the world around them. 
* We would also like to give the user an option to select each activity they would like to experience that day and then create them a schedule that they can save to their phone to reference later as they go about their day.
